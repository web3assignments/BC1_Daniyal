# Motivation for patterns
First pattern that I have implemented is the Guard Check parameter. This ensure me when I am paying out the value has been send.

I have also chosen to use the limitBalanace pattern, I have chosen this pattern because one big task of the smart contract is to hold balances of different projects and personally i don't think it really smart to hold alot of the balance for each transaction, so that's why i have chosen for a limit for each transaction.
